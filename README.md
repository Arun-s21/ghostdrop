About The Project
GhostDrop is a full-stack anonymous messaging application built with a modern technology stack. It provides a secure and engaging platform for users to receive feedback and messages without the sender needing to reveal their identity. Each user gets a unique, shareable link that they can post on social media or send to friends. Anyone with the link can drop a message, which the user can then view and manage on their private, protected dashboard.

This project was built to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of full-stack web development, including user authentication, database management, API design, and modern frontend development with Next.js and React.

Key Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration with email verification and password hashing.

Protected Dashboard: A private, authenticated dashboard for users to view their received messages.

Unique Shareable Links: Each user gets a unique public URL (e.g., ghostdrop.com/u/username) to share.

Anonymous Messaging: Anyone with the link can send a message without needing an account.

Message Management: Users can view all their messages, sorted by the most recent.

Secure Sessions: Uses JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) stored in HttpOnly cookies for secure session management.
